# stub

 A Dart micro-package to help you stub methods in your tests

 if you feel that you are testing the mock rather than your code
 when you just need a simple `stub` you may want to take a look

 if instead you are looking for a complete mocking experience
 or the classes you want to mock have 200 lines and 20 methods
 this package is probably not for you

---

### Get Started

add to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies: 
  stub: <latest version>
```
