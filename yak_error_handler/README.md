# yak_error_handler

This is small and lightweight package based on `riverpod`
to handle the typical `void Function(Object,Stacktrace)` from `try / catch`
and easy to integrate with `yak_runner`


add to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies: 
  yak_error_handler: <latest version>
```

## Buy me a coffee

Whether you use this package, have learned something from it, or just like it, please consider supporting it by buying me a coffee, so I can dedicate more time on open-source projects like this :)
